<h2>About JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is front (client side) and back end (server side) language that is ubiquitous and pretty much disliked by everyone who has experince with it and is being honest with themselves. In my opionion it has reached the stage of evolution where it's complexity coupled with an overwhelming array of libraries are starting to make people select other options for interactivity in web pages. That said, it is deeply embedded in so many places that wholesale removal of it is impractical and a huge number of developers know the language making it an attractive choice for companies looking for a large talent pool. So it ain't goin' anywhere soon (keep an eye on PHP though). Turning away from JavaScript will take a long time (thus, it's still a good skill to pick up and use).</p>
<p>The language can be run in the front-end (client side) in browsers or on the back end (server side) under NodeJS (most popular), Deno, Next.js, Meteor and a few other environments. Initially, I would recommend focusing your studies on front-end JavaScript and not dive into any back end work until you have a good command of the language. After getting very aquainted with JavaScript, it would be a good idea to eventually step up to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. Stated simply, TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. JavaScript <span style="font-style: italic">is TypeScript</span>. You can change the file extension of a JavaScript file, .js, to the extension of a TypeScript file, .ts, and all or most of your JavaScript file should work fine. Some of the 'features' of JavaScript that cost you hours of debugging will be remediated by using TypeScript insted. However you must know JavaScript pretty well in order to understand what TypeScript is doing or it will throw exceptions at you that you will never be able to work out. So study JavaScript, get good, move on to TypeScript.</p>
<p>You can either embed JavaScript in an HTML file or import it into an HTML from it's own native JavaScript file. You can run JavaScript commands directly in a browser to check and see how they work (pretty cool actually). There is so much to say about JavaScript that I'll leave it up to you to find good tutorials on them.</p>
