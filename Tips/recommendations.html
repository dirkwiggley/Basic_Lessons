<ul>
  <li>If you look at the code for this site, don't get discouraged. There's a lot of formatting and JavaScript I put in to make the site usable. The code of the site is not intended to be the tutorial themselves. Do feel free to look and ask questions though.</li>
  <li>Look at the code from other sites using your browser. Press <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;CNTRL + SHIFT&gt; + i</span> to open the developer tools panel and look at the code there under the <span style="font-style: italic">Sources tab</span> . You can see network calls it makes under the <span style="font-style: italic">Network tab</span>, find HTML elements in a crowded page using the <span style="font-style: italic">Elements tab</span>, and see error messages and developer output under the <span style="font-style: italic">Console tab</span>.</li>
  <li>Download and use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> as your IDE (Integrated Development Evironment). You can use anything you want really (I started learning using the VI editor and a browser) but VSCode is widely used and has a plethora of plugins that can make your life significantly easier.</a></li>
  <li>Pick a browser to test on that is highly used but don't get religious about it. Different browsers <span style="font-style: italic">will behave differently</span> from time to time. It will frustrate the heck out of you but press on.</span></li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a></li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel account</a></li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox account</a></li>
  <li>Search on YouTube for various coding topics. Subscribe to channels you like.</li>
