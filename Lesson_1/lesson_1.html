  <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Lesson 1. Here we will create a simple HTML page in the VSCode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and display it in a browser. We'll also examine a feature or two of the browser. Lets begin.</p>
  <p>Open VSCode and create a new file named index.html using the command bar command: File => New File => &lt;file name&gt; (in this case the file name is index.html). The name could be just about anything as long as it has an .htm or .html file extension. The name index.html is the name used as a standard entry point for web sites.</p>
  <img src="./lesson_1_2.png" style="height: 400px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>
  <p>Now let's make a template HTML page. Click inside the page and use the command <span style="font-style: bold;">! + lt&;ENTERgt&;</span> and an HTML template should fill the file:</p>
  <img src="./lesson_1_3.png" style="height: 400px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>
  <p>Note in the <span style="font-style: italic;">title</span> tag (which is inside the <span style="font-style: italic;">head</span> tag) you can change the title and that value will be what appears in the tab for your page when you open it in a browser. I chose the acronym for the World Trade Federation (WTF) and when I open the page in a browser I see this:</p>
  <img src="./lesson_1_4.png" style="height: 60px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>
  <p>Time to add something to this page. The <span style="font-style: italic;">body</span> tag is where you place content that should be displayed on your page. If things that you have entered outside the <span style="font-style: italic;">body</span> tag appear on your page, you have made an error and need to start debugging to figure out what happened (unlikely at this point but I thought I should bring it up). Let's do the standard Hello world using a few tags to show how they look:</p>
  <img src="./lesson_1_5.png" style="height: 400px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>
  <p>And in the browser:</p>
  <img src="./lesson_1_6.png" style="height: 400px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>
  <p>Note that every time you save the file in your IDE (VSCode), you will need to refresh your browser to see the changes. The browser doesn't know you've updated the file, you need to refresh it manually. Feel free to experiment and try some different tags, remove the <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> tag from around the <span style="font-style: italic;">sub</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">sup</span> tags to see what happens. Go nuts!</p>
  <p>Next, create a new file with any name you like but be sure to use an .html extension. Add the HTML template to it as described as above and then add your own text and tags. Look up more tags at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp">W3 Schools</a> and give 'em a try.</a></p>
  <p>That's a decent stopping point.</p>
